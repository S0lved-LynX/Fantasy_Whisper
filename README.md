# Fantasy Whisper

This app is made for shy people that feel too embarrased to ask their partner if they want to fulfill their fantasies. 

## Installation

You have 2 options for installation. 

1. Download the included compiled apk and install it from local storage. Android will probably inform that you need to enable downloading from local storage. After installation **I suggest you to turn it off for your safety**.
2. If you have Android Studio and are experienced with Android programming you can clone the github repository and compile code for yourself.

## Usage 

> TODO: Update for multiple people

After starting the app you can decide which type of fantasies you want to share with your partner/friend or whoever you are with. There are few categories you can choose from:

1. Kinks
2. Places
3. Roleplay

Then one of you fills his fantasies into form and clicks **Confirm**. The screen will change for the second participant to fill the needs and **Confirm**. Then when you both want to see you proceed to the result which will show items that were chosen by both. After clicking **End** results will be securely deleted and form needs to be filled again if you want to see the result again. 

There is also a second mode where one partner shares fantasy that will be done against the second partner and the second will share what is wanted to be done to self.

There is also a quick menu with short description about kinks.

## Promises

This app wasn't made for ads or some ducking data collection, you can go through the code yourself and even submit it to some AI to show that it doesn't collect or share any data. It was also created with privacy in mind so it will enforce the best practices.

## Disclaimer

> **BIG DISCLAIMER**: this app shouldn't contain any illegal kinks (please be aware that vore can be roleplayed and not really performed). Also if the thing you want to do is legal in your country - I don't care I won't implement the big three of absolutely disgusting things. **Also** ***CONSENT*** exist, please be aware of that and **DON'T** force anybody into anything.

I'm not really a god so please be aware that **I can make a coding mistake** that will make the app insecure. Also I'm not a native English speaker so if anything sounds like it was written by some first grader then yeah it was ;).
